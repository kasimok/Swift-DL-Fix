# Swift-DL

A macOS video/audio downloader. Think of it as a youtube downloader that works on many sites.

Swift-DL is a YT-DLP clone of the Youtube-DL GUI [_Get It_](https://github.com/Kevin-De-Koninck/Get-It) that includes additional bug fixes.

**Note**: Swift-DL requires _Homebrew_. The required dependencies will be installed with _Homebrew_.

Each component can be uninstalled **if** it is not used by another program on your Mac. To remove each separate dependency, run `brew uninstall [component]`, replacing `[component]` with the name of the dependency you no longer need.

To completely clean everything that is brew related:

# About

Swift-DL will download audio and/or video from many websites such as YouTube, BBC, Instagram, and many more. It's a GUI built on the YT-DLP command-line tool, which is itself a fork of the popular program YouTube-DL, but with a clean and easy to use user interface.

It will save your settings dynamically or you can restore to the default settings. The default settings will download the audio from a video, convert it to an MP3 and save it to you downloads folder. This seems to be the most common use for using YT-DLP/YouTube-DL, though downloading the entire video is also supported in the settings pane.

# Common issues

Because this is a simple GUI wrapper for the `yt-dlp` command, most issues can be traced back to the binary. The can usually be resolved by simply updating YT-DLP as follows: `sudo yt-dlp --update`.

It is a known issue that sometimes you will see an error message that the download has failed. I'm working on a quick fix for this, but most of the time it completes the download perfectly. Be sure to check your Downloads folder for the audio/video file(s) to see if it actually worked properly before creating a new issue.
